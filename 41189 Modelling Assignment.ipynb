    "Technological advancement in developing countries has been limited due to the amount of resources available. This places a disadvantage on those affected, to have a lack of education. Globally, this is a known issue as compared to developed countries’ education systems, the developing have poorer infrastructure, limited resources to facilitate people to study, which in turn results in fewer opportunities. This is an important issue in society today as education has the power to broaden our understanding and perspectives, and to change and prepare people for the ever changing world around them. Education is relevant in many communities today as it reduces the risk of poverty, improves productivity and education, gains critical thinking and analysis skills, and people have a greater sense of discipline (UOP, 2019)."
